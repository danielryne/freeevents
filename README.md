# Free Texas

Free Texas gives users a listing of free events in different cities around Texas. When you open the site, you will have the option to select the date and city you would like to go out in. Currently, the cities are Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. Once you have selected your day and location, the pages will display all free events in the Food/Drinks and Music categories for the day. If there are not 5 free events that day, it will show however many there are. It also gives you the weather for the time of the event so you can be ready for anything. Enjoy y'all! 

This web app was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, the Eventbrite API and Open Weather Map API.
